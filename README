Simplified RailsCoders
=======================

This is a simplified version of the RailsCoders example application developed by author Alan Bradburne for the book "Practical Rails Social Networking Sites" (published by Apress).

This version is forked from Alan Bradburne's initial import of the RailsCoders application at GitHub on April 14, 2008.
